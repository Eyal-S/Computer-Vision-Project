__Computer Vision Project: Video Stabilization, Background Subtraction, Video Matting, Object Tracking__

The objectives of this project are the following:

1. Stabilizing the video frames in ‘INPUT’. Saving the stabilized video as ‘stabilized.avi’.

2. Extracting the walking person from ‘stabilized.avi’ using background subtraction. 
This video will only contain the walking person. Saving the extracted person as ‘extracted.avi’. 
(saving also a binary mask of the walking person as ‘binary.avi’).

3. Using image matting, placing the walking person from ‘extracted.avi’ in ‘background.jpg’. 
Saving this video as ‘matted.avi’. The new video file will have a walking person with a static background.
